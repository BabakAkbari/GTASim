# GTASim

GTASim is an open-source simulator for drones, planes, cars, boats and various other vehicles based on GTA V.

## How to use it

### Installing FiveM client

GTASim is built on a customized dedicated FiveM server. You need to install FiveM client to connect to the server.
Follow the instructions in the link to [install FiveM Client](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/client-manual/installing-fivem/)
* Make sure you have installed and updated GTA V.
* Download [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) off the website.
* Run FiveM.exe. If you run the installer in an empty folder, FiveM will install there. Otherwise, it will install in `%localappdata%\FiveM`.

### Setting up a server

Follow the instructions in the link to [set up your FXServer](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server/)
You can install FXServer on both [Windows](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server/#windows) and [Linux](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server/#linux) throughout this instruction we assume that we are using Windows to run the server.
